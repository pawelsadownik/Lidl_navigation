# ItemStore
Originally the example code for an article in the JavaMagazin. (branch/master)
In branch **graphql** extended by a GraphQL interface.

# Build and run tests with
`mvn clean install`


# Description
Further descriptions of the source code can be found here: [Spring Boot GraphQL](http://www.hameister.org/SpringBootGraphQL.html).


# Disclaimer
My projects, which I publish on Github, are prototypes that reflect my knowledge
at the time I checked in the code and are primarily meant to allow me to copy or paste
code snippets. If I want to solve a similar problem in the future.
Often there is also a blogpost on my website [www.hameister.org](http://www.hameister.org) about the code snippets, which describes the source code in more detail.
The code was never meant for strangers to blindly copy and use it in their projects in production.
If the snippets help someone, I'm glad, but I do not guarantee the correctness.
In addition, I only take care of the projects when I have my own needs.
If someone has suggested corrections, they are welcome to submit a pull request.
For tips and suggestions for improvement, of course, I am very grateful.
There is always someone who knows more about a technology or framework.
